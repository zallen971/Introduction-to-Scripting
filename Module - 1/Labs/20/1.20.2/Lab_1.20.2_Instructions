Given variables angle_elev and shadow_len that represent the angle of elevation and the shadow length of a tree,
respectively, assign tree_height with the height of the tree.


Ex: If the input is:
0.5236
17.5
then the output is:
Tree height: 10.103658280211672
Note: tree_height = tan(angle_elev) * shadow_len
