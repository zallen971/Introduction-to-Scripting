1.24 LAB: Expression for calories burned during workout
The following equation estimates the average calories burned for a person when exercising,
which is based on a scientific journal article (source):

Calories = ( (Age x 0.2757) + (Weight x 0.03295) + (Heart Rate x 1.0781) â€” 75.4991 ) x Time / 8.368

Write a program using inputs age (years), weight (pounds), heart rate (beats per minute), and time (minutes),
respectively. Output the average calories burned for a person.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print('Calories: {:.2f} calories'.format(calories))


Ex: If the input is:

49
155
148
60
then the output is:

Calories: 736.21 calories
