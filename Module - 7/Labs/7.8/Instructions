Write a program that first reads in the name of an input file and
then reads the file using the csv.reader() method. The file contains a list of words separated by commas.
Your program should output the words and their frequencies
(the number of times each word appears in the file) without any duplicates.


Ex: If the input is:

input1.csv
and the contents of input1.csv are:

hello,cat,man,hey,dog,boy,Hello,man,cat,woman,dog,Cat,hey,boy
the output is:

hello 1
cat 2
man 2
hey 2
dog 2
boy 2
Hello 1
woman 1
Cat 1
Note: There is a newline at the end of the output, and input1.csv is available to download.
