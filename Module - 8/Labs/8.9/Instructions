Complete the Car class by creating an attribute purchase_price (type int) and
the method print_info() that outputs the car's information.

Ex: If the input is:

2011
18000
2018

where 2011 is the car's model year, 18000 is the purchase price, and 2018 is the current year,
then print_info() outputs:


Car's information:
   Model year: 2011
   Purchase price: 18000
   Current value: 5770
Note: print_info() should use three spaces for indentation.
