Complete the Team class implementation. For the instance method get_win_percentage(),
the formula is: team_wins / (team_wins + team_losses)

Note: Use floating-point division.

Ex: If the input is:

Ravens
13
3
where Ravens is the team's name, 13 is the number of team wins, and 3 is the number of team losses,
the output is:

Congratulations, Team Ravens has a winning average!
If the input is Angels 80 82, the output is:

Team Angels has a losing average.
